- This repo demonstrates that <MeshPortalMaterial /> does not support `samples` prop
- This causes react native to throw `Error: Exception in HostFunction: EXGL: renderbufferStorageMultisample() isn't implemented yet!`
- Bug only tested on macOS paired with an iPhone
- Install expo go on your iPhone
- `npm i && npm start`
